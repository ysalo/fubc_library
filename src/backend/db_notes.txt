Bible:
    Not adding barcodes
    Adding: 
    - check translation, increment the quantity 
    Loan: 
    - check translation, check quantity, decrement quantity.

General Notes:
    - figure out how to add item_type in a more automatic way 
    - make title non unique? because there can be a different book with the same title but different author and just do it with logic?
    - don't forget to set the update and delete constraints to default to ensure referential integrity
    - a case can happen where there is a duplicate barcode but different book_id. there will be an entry in the Book_To_Barcode 
        table but the barcode will no appear in the Item table.
